# Hex Tools
A collection of useful dev tools for your day to day workflow

## Included
- `image-min`
  - A useful tool to compress image file sizes, without losing quality. Creates optimised versions of your JPEGs, PNGs and creates a handy .WEBP file as well for next level, future safe images.
  - To install, make sure you have [GULP.js](https://gulpjs.com/) installed globally, and install using `npm i`. Make sure you have these installed as well using `brew`:
  - `brew install imagemagick`
  - `brew install graphicsmagick`
  - Just drop your big 'ol images into the `images-source` folder, and optimised files will be generated in `images-optimised`.
